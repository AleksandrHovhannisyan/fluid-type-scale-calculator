# Fluid Type Scale Generator

> Generate font size variables for a fluid type scale.

Customize everything, grab the output CSS, and drop it into any existing design system.

## Motivation

Most apps do one of two things:

1. They generate fluid typography variables, which are great for responsive sizing.
2. They generate a type scale, which defines a harmonic relationship between font size steps.

Why not do both?

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn serve` and visit `localhost:8080` to view the app.
